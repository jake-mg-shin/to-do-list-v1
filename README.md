# to-do-list-v1
To-Do List with Javascript


### note: Feb 9, 2020

#### found some problem
- API does not work at MS Explorer
- Should aviod the page refresh timing for writing to-do:
  - The writing will be disappeared when page refresh, if the writing is not done
- To-do list can be gotten out of th to-do-list table if the to-do is longer than table

#### need to improve 
- Display a sign on completed to-do
- Display current location on a map
- Make reordering of to-do by priority
