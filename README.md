# To-Do App

>This To-Do app is my first result by only JavaScript. Although the base concept was from a chrome web application as [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=fr), I focused on the part of To-Do List more. Check it out, my ***[To-Do App](https://jake-mg-shin.github.io/to-do-list-v1/)***.
